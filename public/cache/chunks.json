The crew were Neil A. Armstrong, Commander ; Mi chael Collins , Command Module Pilot ; and Edwin E.  Aldrin, Jr. , Lunar Module Pilot .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The space vehicle was launched from Kennedy Space Center , Florida ,  at 8:32 :00 a. m . , e.s. t . , July 16 , 1969 . The activities during earth  orbit checkout , translunar inj e ct i on , transposition and docking , spacecraft ejection, and translunar coast were s imilar to those of Apollo 10 .  Only one midcourse correction , performed at about 27 hours elapsed time ,  was required during trans lunar coast .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The spacecraft was inserted into lunar orbit at ab out 76 hours , and  the circulari zation maneuver was performed two revoluti ons later . Initi al  checkout of lunar module systems was satisfactory , and after a planned  rest peri od , the Commander and Lunar Module Pilot entered the lunar module  to prepare for des cent .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The two spacecraft were undocked at ab out 100 hours , followed by  separation of the command and servi ce modules from the lunar module .  Descent orbit insertion was performed at approximately 101-l/2 hours , and  powered descent to the lunar surface began about 1 hour later. Operation  ·of the gui dan ce and des cent propulsion systems was nominal . The lunar  module was maneuvered manually approximat ely 1100 feet downrange from the  nominal landing point during the final 2-1/2 minutes of des cent . The  spacecraft landed in the Sea of Tranquillity at 102 : 45:40 .

Four hours later, the lunar orbit circularization maneuver was performed to place the spacecraft in a 65.7- by 53.8-mile orbit. The Lunar Module Pilot entered the lunar module at about 81 hours for initial power-up and systems checks. After the planned sleep period was completed at 93-l/2 hours, the crew donned their suits, transferred to the lunar module, and made final preparations for descent to the lunar surface. The lunar module was undocked on time at about 100 hours. After the exterior of the lunar module was inspected by the Command Module Pilot, a separation maneuver was performed with the service module reaction control system.\n\nThe descent orbit insertion maneuver was performed with the descent propulsion system at 101-1/2 hours. Trajectory parameters following this maneuver were as planned, and the powered descent initiation was on time at 102-l/2 hours. The maneuver lasted approximately 12 minutes, with engine shutdown occurring almost simultaneously with the lunar landing in the Sea of Tranquillity. The coordinates of the actual landing point"

        "html": "<p block-type=\"Text\">Two periods of ci slunar midcourse navigat i on, using the command  module computer program ( P23 ), were planned and executed. The first,  at 6 hours, was primarily to estab li sh the apparent horiz on altitude for  opti cal marks in the computer. The first determination was begun at a  distance of approximately 30 000 miles, while the second, at 24 hours,  was designed to accurately determine the opti cal bias errors. Excess  time and fuel were expended during the first peri od because of di ffi culty  in locating the sub stellar point of each star. Ground-supplied gimb al  angles were used rather than those from the onboard computer. This technique was devised because computer s olutions are un constrained ab out the  opti cs shaft axi s ; therefore, the computer is unable to predi ct if lunar  module structure might block the line of sight to the star. The groundsupplied angles prevented lunar module structure from occulting the star,  but were not accurate in locating the precise substellar point, as evidenced by the fact that the s extant reti cle pattern was not parallel to  the horizon . Additional maneuvers were required to achieve a parallel  reti cle pattern near the point of hori zon-st ar superposition.</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The second period of navigation measurements was less di ffi cult,  largely because the earth appeared much smaller and trim maneuvers to the  sub stellar point could be made much more quickly and economi cally.</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The digital autopi lot was used to initiate the passive thermal control mode at a pos itive roll rate of 0 . 3 deg/se c, with the positive longitudinal axis of the spacecraft pointed toward the e clipti c north pole  .during translunar coast ( the ecliptic s outh pole was the direction used  during trans earth coast ). After the roll rate was estab lished, thruster  firing was prevented by turning off all 16 switches for the s ervi ce module thrusters . In general, this method was highly successful in that it  maintained a s atisfactory spacecraft attitude for very long periods of  time and allowed the crew to s leep without fear of either entering gimbal  lock or encountering unacceptab le thermal condit ions .

The technique used was to approach the target area in an inertial attitude hold mode, with the X-axis being roughly horizontal when the spacecraft reached an elevation angle of 35 degrees from the target, at which point a pitch down of approximately 0.3 deg/sec was begun. This technique was necessary to assure a 2-l/2 minute mark period evenly distributed near the zenith and was performed wi·thout difficulty.\n\nThe second navigation exercise was performed on the following day shortly prior to separation from the lunar module. A series of five marks was taken on a small crater on the inner north wall of crater 130 . The previously described technique was used, except that two forward firing thrusters (one yaw and one pitch) were iriliibited to preclude thrust impingement on the deployed rendezvous-radar and steerable antennas. The reduced pitch authority doubled the time required, to approximately 3 seconds when using acceleration command, to achieve a 0.3 deg/sec pitchdown rate. In both cases, the pitch rate was achieved without reference to any onboard rate instrumentation by simply timing the duration of acceleration-command hand controller inputs, since the Command Module Pilot was in the lower equipment bay at the time.\n\nTo prevent the two vehicles from slipping and hence upsetting the docked lunar module platform alignment, roll thruster firings were inhibited after probe preload until the tunnel had been vented to approximately l psi. Only single roll jet authority was used after the l psi point was reached and until the tunnel pressure was zero."

        "text": "4 .12.4 Surface Exploration\n\nWork in the 1/6-g environment was a pleasant experience . Adaptation to movement was not difficult and seemed to be quite natural. Certain specific peculiarities , such as the effect of the mass versus the lack of traction , can be anticipated but complete familiarization need not be pursued.\n\nThe most effective means of walking seemed to be the lope that evolved naturally . The fact that both feet were occasionally off the ground at the s ame time , plus the fact that the feet did not return to the surface as rapidly as on earth, required some anticipation before attempting to stop . Although movement was not difficult , there was noticeable resistance provided by the suit .\n\nOn future flights , crewmembers may want to consider kneeling in order to work with their hands . Getting to and from the kneeling position would be no problem , and being able to do more work with the hands would increase the productive capability.\n\nPhotography with the Hasselblad cameras on the remote control unit mounts produced no problems . The first panorama was taken while the camera was hand-held ; however , it was much easier to operate on the mount . The handle on the camera was adequate , and very few pictures were triggered inadvertently.\n\nThe solar wind experiment was easily deployed. As with the other operations involving lunar surface penetration , it was only possible to penetrate the lunar surface material about 4 or 5 inches .

In general , the transearth coast period was characterized by a general relaxation on the part of the crew , with plenty of time available to sample the excellent variety of food packets and to take photographs of the shrinking moon and the growing earth .\n\n4.19 ENTRY\n\nBecause of the presence of thunderstorms in the primary recovery area ( 1285 miles downrange from the entry interface of 400 000 feet ), the targeted landing point was moved to a range of 1500 miles from entry interface . This change required the use of computer program P65 ( skipup control routine ) in the computer , in addition to those programs used for the planned shorter range entry . This change caused the crew some apprehension , since such entries had rarely been practiced in preflight simulations .

        "html": "<h4>5.7 RENDEZVOUS</h4>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">Immediately after ascent insertion , the Commander began a platform  alignment using the lunar module telescope. During this time, the ground  relayed the lunar module state vector to the command module computer to  permit execution of navigation updates using the sextant and the VHF ranging system . The lunar module platform alignment took somewhat longer than  expected ; consequently , the coelliptic sequence initiation program was  entered into the computer about 7 minutes later than planned. This delay  allowed somewhat less than the nominal 18 radar navigation updates between  insertion and the first rendezvous maneuver . Also, the first range rate  measurement for the backup solution was missed ; however, this loss was  not significant, since both the lunar module and :command module guidance  systems were performing normally. Figure 5-19 show·s the ascent and rendezvous trajectory and their relationship in lunar orbit.</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">Prior to coelliptic sequence initiation, the lunar module out-ofplane velocity was computed by the command module to be minus 1 .0 ft/sec,  a value small enough to be deferred until teroinal phase initiation . The  final lunar module solution for coelliptic sequence was a 51.5-ft/sec maneuver to be performed with the Z-axis reaction control thrusters, with  a planned ignition time of 125:19 : 34.7.</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">Following the coelliptic sequence initiation maneuver, the constant  di fferential height program was called up in both vehicles.

At launch, the total oxygen quantity was 615 pounds ( 79 pounds above the  minimum red-line limit ), and the hydrogen quantity was 54.1 pounds (1.0  pound above the minimum red-line limit ). The overall consumption from  the system was nominal during the flight .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">During the flight , it was discovered that one heater in oxygen tank 2  was inoperative . Records show that it had failed between the times of the  countdown demonstration test and the actual countdown , and current measurements indicate that the element had an open circuit , This anomaly is  dis cussed in detail in section 16 .1.2.</p>\n<h4>8.4 VHF RANGING</h4>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The operation of the VHF ranging system was nominal during des cent  and from lunar lift-off until orbital insertion . Following insertion ,  a number of tracking dropouts were experienced. These dropouts resulted  from negative circuit margins caused by use of the lunar module aft VHF  antenna instead of the forward antenna . After the antennas were switched,  VHF ranging operation returned to normal . A maximum range of 246 miles  was measured, and a comparis on of the VHF ranging data with rendezvous  radar data and the predicted trajectory showed very close agreement .</p>\n<h4>8,5 INSTRUMENTATION</h4>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The instrumentation system , including the data storage equipment ,  the central timing equipment , and the signal conditioning equipment , supported the mission.</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The data storage equipment did not operate during entry because the  circuit breaker was open . The circuit breaker which supplies ac power to  the recorder also controls operation of the S-band FM transmitter . When  the television camera and associated monitor were to be powered without  transmitting to a ground station , the circuit breaker was opened to disable the S-band FM transmitter . This breaker was inadvertently left open  after the last television transmiss ion .</p>",

        "html": "<h4>9.3 ELECTRICAL POWER</h4>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The electrical power system performed s atis factorily . The de bus  voltage was maintained above 28 .8 volts throughout the flight . The maximum observed load was 81 amperes , during powered des cent initiation .  Both inverters performed as expected.</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The knob on the as cent engine arm circuit breaker was broken , probably by the aft edge of the oxygen purge system hitting the breaker during preparations for extravehi cular activity . In any event , this circuit  breaker was closed without difficulty when required prior to as cent ( section J6 .2.ll ) .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">At staging , the des cent batteries had supplied 1055 A-h of a nominal  total capacity of 1600 A-h . The di fference in load sharing at staging  was 2 A-h on batteries 1 and 2 and 23 A-h on batteries 3 and 4, and both  of these values are acceptable .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">At lunar module j ettison , the two as cent batteries had delivered  336 A-h of a nominal total capacity of 592 A-h . The as cent b atteries  continued to supply power, for a total of 680 A-h at 28 V de or above .</p>\n<h4>9.4 COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</h4>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">Overall performance of the S-band steerable antenna was s atisfactory .  Some difficulties were experienced, however , during des cent of the lunar  module . Prior to the s cheduled 180-degree yaw maneuver , the signal  strength dropped below the tracking level and the antenna broke lock several times .

The effect remained noticeable and significant until after the end of the braking phase when the engine was throttled down to begin rate-of-descent control . The slosh response has been reproduced postflight by making slight variations in the slosh model damping ratio.\n\nThe ascent maneuver was nominal with the crew again reporting the wallowing tendency inherent in the control technique used. As shown in table 9.6-V , the velocity at insertion was 2 ft/sec higher than planned. This has been attributed to a difference in the predicted and actual tail·· off characteristics of the engine ."

Two characteristi cs suggest that the mare materi al is relatively thin : an unusual ri dge ring , named Lamont , located in the southwest part of the mare , may be locali zed over the shallowly buried rim of a pre-mare crater :; and no large positive gravity anomaly , like those over the deep marefilled circular basins , is as sociated with Mare Tranquillitatis ( ref. 7 ) .\n\nThe s outhern part of Mare Tranquilli tat is is crossed by relatively faint but distinct north-northwest trending rays and prominent secondary craters ass ociated with the crater Theophi lus . About 15 kilometers west of the landing site is a fairly prominent north-northeast trending ray . The ray may be related to either of the craters Alfraganus or Tycho, located 160 and 1500 kilometers , respectively , to the southwest .\n\nA hill of highland-like material protrudes above the mare surface 52 kilometers east-southeast of the landing site . This structure suggeste: the mare material is very thin in this region , perhaps no more than a few hundred meters thi ck ."

( Refer to section 11 .6 for a discussion of lunar surface photography .)\n\nPhot ographic documentation of the lunar surface was acqui red with a 16-mm sequence camera, a close-up stereo camera, and two 70-mm still cameras ( one with an 80-mm lens and the other with a 60-mm lens ). The camera with the 60-mm lens was intended primarily for gathering geological data, and a transparent plate containing a 5 by 5 matrix of crosses was mounted in front of the film plane to define the coordinate system for the optical geometry.\n\nPhotographic procedures . - Photographic procedures planned for the lunar geologi c experiment for use with the 70-mm Hass elblad with 60-mm lens were the panorama survey , the s ample area survey , and the s ingle s ample survey .\n\nThe panorama survey consists of 12 pi ctures taken at intervals of 30 degrees in azimuth and aimed at the horizon with the lens focused at 22 .5 meters . The resulting pictures , when matched together as a mosaic , form a continuous 360-degree view of the landing site from which relative azimuth angles can be measured between features of interest . The Commander took a parti al panorama from the foot of the ladder immediately after he stepped to the lunar surface ( fig. 11-5, part a) . Also , three panoramas were taken from the verti ces of an imaginary triangle surrounding the lunar module ( for example , fig. 11-5 , parts b and c)."

        "text": "The sites of three of the contingency s ample rocks have - been located and thos e of two tent atively identified by comparing thei r shapes and sizes from the lunar module window and surface photographs with photographs taken of the specimens at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory . Evidence for the identification and orient ation of rock A ( fig. 11-9 ) was obtained from the presence of a s addle-shaped notch on its exposed side. Rock C ( fig. 11-10 ) was characterized by the pitlike depress ion visible on the photographs . Rock B ( fig. ll-9 ) is only about 2 centimeters acros s and at this time has not been correlated with the specimens in the Lunar Receiving Lab orat ory ,\n\nDuring bulk sampling , rock fragments were collected primarily on the northeast rim of the large double crater s outhwest of the lunar module .\n\nPhotographs t aken of the documented s ample locality (south of the plus Z foot pad ) before and after the extravehi cular activity were s earched for evidence of rocks that might have been included in the sample . Figures ll-11 and ll-12 illustrate that three rather large rocks ( up to several tens of centimeters ) were removed from their respective positions shown on the photographs taken before the extravehicular activity . A closer view of these three rocks was obtained during the extravehi cular activity ( fig. ll-13 ).\n\n11 .1.6 Geologi c Hand Tools\n\nThe geologi c hand tools ( fig. A-5) include d the contingency s ample container , s coop , hammer, extension handle , two core tubes , tongs , two large s ample b ags , weighing s cale , two s ample return containers , and the gnomon , Als o included were small s ample bags , numbered for use in document ation. All t ools were us ed except the gnomon . The crew reported that , in general , the t ools worked well .\n\nThe large s coop , attached to the extension handle , was used primarily during bulk s ampling to collect rocks and fine-grained material . The large s coop was us ed about 22 times in collecting the bulk sample . As expected from l/6-g simulations , s ome lunar materi al tended to fall out of the s coop at the end of s cooping motion.\n\nThe hammer was us ed to drive the core tubes att ached to the extens ion handle . Hard enough b lows could be struck to dent the top of the extension handle . The extension handle was att ached to the large s coop for bulk s ampling and to the core tubes for t aking core s amples .\n\nTwo core tubes were driven and each collected a s atis factory s ample .

The foot ing was not s ecure because the varying thi ckness of unstab le lalfer material tended to s li de in an unpredi ctable fashi on .\n\nThe material on the rim and walls of larger-si ze craters , with wall s lopes ranging up to 35 degrees appeared to be more compact and stable than that on the smaller craters which were traversed.\n\n11.2.2 Examination of Lunar Material Samples\n\nPreliminary observations were made of the general appearance , structure , texture , color , grain-size di stribution , consistency , compactness , and me chani cal behavior of the fine-grained materi al s ampled by the core tubes and collected during the contingency , bulk , and documented s ampling . These inve stigations will be reported in greater detail in subsequent s cience reports .\n\n11 . 3 EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\nA tot al of 22 kilograms of lunar materi al was returned by the Apollo 11 crew ; 11 kilograms were rock fragments more than 1 centimeter in diameter and 11 kilograms were smaller part i culate materi al. Because the documented s ample container was filled by pi cking up selected rocks with tongs , the container held a variety of large rocks ( t ot al 6 .0 kilograms). The total bulk s ample was 14 .6 kilograms ."

Data showing heater currents for prelaun ch checkout veri fied that both  he.ater elements were operational through the countdown demonstration  test . However, the current readings recorded during the tank pressurization in the launch countdown showed that one heater in oxygen tank 2 had  failed. This information was not made known to proper channels for dispos iti on prior to the flight , s ince no specification limits were called  out in the test procedure .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">Manufacturing records for all blo ck II oxygen tanks showed that  there have been no thermal-switch nor electrical-continuity failures in  the program; two failures occurred during the insulation resistance tests .  One failure was attributed to moisture in the connector . After this unit  was dri ed, it pas sed all acceptance tests . The other failure was i dentified in the heater as sembly prior to installation in a tank . This was  also an insulation problem and' would not have prevented the heater from  functioning normally .</p>\n<p block-type=\"Text\">The caus e of the flight failure was probably an intermittent contact  on a terminal board in the heater circuit. The 16-gage wiring at the  board has exhibited intermittencies several t imes in the past. This is  the s ame type terminal board that was found to be the caus e of the control engine problem in this flight ( see s e ct i on 16 .1 . 3 ) .</p>",

Without the c apacitor , a slow change in flow rate in the vi cinity of the threshold voltage of relalf Kl will cause this relalf to continuous ly open and clos e ( ch atter ).\n\nRelalf K2 has a slower dropout time than relalf Kl ; therefore , if relalf Kl is chattering , relay K2 may not be affected, so that the 16-second time delay continues to time out . Cons equently , master alarms c an be initiated without resetting the 16-second timer.\n\nThe filter capacitor was open during postflight tests , and the master alarms were duplicated with s low , de creasing flow rates .\n\nThere has been no previous failure history of these metali zed MYlar capacitors as sociated with the flow s ens ors . No corre ctive acti on is required.\n\nThis anomaly is closed.\n\n16 .1. 6 Indi cated Closure of Propellant Isolation Valves\n\nThe propellant isolation valve s on quad B of the s ervice module reaction cont rol system closed during command and s ervi ce module s eparation from the S-IVB . A similar problem was encountered on the Apollo 9 mission (see the Anomaly Summary in ref. 14 ). Tests after Apollo 9 indi cated that a valve with normal magnetic lat ch forces would clos e at shock levels as low as 87g with an 11-millisecond duration; however, with durations in the expe cted range of 0 . 2 to 0 . 5 milliseconds , shock levels as high as 670g would not clos e the valves . 1�e expe cted range of shock is 180g to 260g .\n\nTwo valves having the nominal latching force of 7 pounds were selecte&lt;i for shock testing. It was found that shocks of 80g for 10 milli s econds to shocks of lOOg for 1 millisecond would close the valves . The latching forces for the valves were reduced to 5 pounds , and the valves were shock tested again . The shock require d to close the valves at this reduced latching force was 54g for 10 milliseconds and 75g for 1 mi lli second. After completi on of the shock testing , the valves were examined and tested, and no degradation was noted. Higher shock levels malf have been experienced in flight , and further tests will be c onducted.\n\nA review of the checkout procedures indi cates that the latching force can be degraded only if the procedures are not prope rly implemented , such as the application of reverse current or ac to the circuit. On Apollo 12 a special test has indi c ated that the valve latching force has not been degraded."

The number of s atis factory activations of all the segments does not indicate the existence of a generic problem.\n\nIn order to ensure proper operation under all conditions , for future missions a prelaw�ch test will activate all segments, then the intensity will be varied through the full range while the display is observed for faults.\n\nThis anomaly is closed.\n\n-.\n\n16 .2. 8 Voice Breakup During Extravehicular Activity\n\nVoice-operated relay operation during extravehicular activity caused breakup of voice received by the Network . This breakup was as s ociated with both crewmen but primarily with the Lunar Module Pilot .\n\nIn ground tests , the conditions experienced during the extravehi cular activity were duplicated by decreasing the sens itivity of the lunar module downlink voice-operated keying control from 9 ( maximum) to 8, a decrease of about 7 dB. During chamber tests , lunar module keying by the extravehicular communications system was demonstrated when the sensitivity control was set at 9. The crew indi cated that the pre-extravehicular activity adjustment should have been set in accordance with the on board checklist ( maximum increase ). The crew also verified that they did not experience any voice breakup between each other or from the Network , indicating that the breakup was probably caused by marginal keying of the voice-operated keying circuits of the lunar module downlink rel�.\n\nVoice tapes obtained of the Apollo 11 crew during altitude chamber tests were used in an attempt to duplicate the problem by simulating voice modulation characteristics and levels being fed into the lunar module communications system during the extravehicular activity . These voice tapes modula.ted a signal generator which was received by and relayed through a breadboa.rd ( mockup ) of the lunar module communication system . There was no dis cernible breakup of the relayed voice with the sensitivity control set at 9.\n\nAll analysis and laboratory testing to date indicates that the voice breakup experienced during the extravehicular activity was not an inherent system design problem. Testing has shown that any voice which will key the extravehicular communication system will also key the lunar module relay if the sensitivity control is set at 9."
